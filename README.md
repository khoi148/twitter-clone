## User Stories

The following **required** functionalities are completed (this is a sample): ðŸŽ¯
* [x] The user should be able to enter a message into a text field.
* [x] The user should be able to press "Tweet" and see the message pop in below the text box.
* [x] The user should see a "count" that displays how many more characters the user has remaining, counting down from 140.
* [x] Upon tweeting, the characters remaining text should reset back to 140, and the field should be cleared.
* [x] The application should disallow text of greater than 140 characters.
* [x] The user should be able to "Retweet". Clicking Retweet immediately inserts a copy of that tweet below the original tweet.
* [x] The user should be able to "Like". When "Like" is clicked, the text should change to "Unlike". When "Unlike" is clicked, the text should change to "Like". Alternatively, use a heart icon (colored or not colored).
* [x] When a "Liked" tweet is retweeted, the new tweet should not be liked.
* [x] Each tweet has an optional hashtag. The hashtag should be linked with an anchor tag.
* [x] The user should be able to delete a tweet.
